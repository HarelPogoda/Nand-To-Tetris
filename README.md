# Nand-To-Tetris
This project builds the parts from which a computer is made: From a basic Nand gate, through a compiler for the jack OOP coding language - to a basic operating system.
The "tools" directory containes some Java applications that enable us to run our projects: for instance, if you copy the "screen.jack" file from project 12 into "tools" - 
you can compile it using "JackCompiler.bat" and then run it with "VMEmulator" - then you can see what happenes on our basic computer's screen, using the part of the OS
that operates on the pixels.
